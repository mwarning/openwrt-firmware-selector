# Yet Another Firmware Selector

A simple OpenWrt firmware selector using autocompletion. Uses plain
HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Checkout the [Demo](https://mwarning.github.io/yet-another-firmware-selector/www/).

## Run

* Download the sources and change the working directory
* Start webserver (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`)
* Go to `http://localhost:8000/www/` in your web browser

Configure with [config.js](www/config.js).

## Attended Sysupgrade Support

This firmware selector can speak to a [ASU server](https://github.com/aparcar/asu) to build custom images. To enable the feature, the `asu_url` option in the config.js needs to be set.

## Update Database

The `overview.json` files are based on JSON files created by OpenWrt
(master): `Global build settings  ---> [*] Create JSON info files per build
image`.

A [Python script](misc/collect.py) is included to merge the JSON files into a single overview.json:
```
./collect.py merge bin/ --download-url 'https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/{version}/targets/{target}' > overview.json
```

If you want to scrape the OpenWrt download website and update the config.js automatically:
```
./collect.py scrape https://downloads.openwrt.org /var/www/firmware_selector
```

For the OpenWrt 18.06 and 19.07 releases, you need to patch OpenWrt to output JSON files for collect.py (commit [openwrt/openwrt@881ed09](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/881ed09ee6e23f6c224184bb7493253c4624fb9f)).
